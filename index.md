## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3

While it was more learning the basics, I liked how both parts were able to root my understanding of functions in a fun way. Having to calculate Going into this lab I did not think I would be able to do it, but by the end I completely understood how to call functions.

* Lab 7

This was my second favorite lab, while there was only one part, it helped me understand how if statements work by making me use them to find out if parking would be allowed at a set time. I believe this was a really fun way to teach them as well.

* Lab 8, part 1

This was my favorite lab of them all because it was just challenging enough for a struggle, while not feeling impossible. Trying to find out how to use loops to calculate the average of four scores was surprisingly fun and taught me a lot.
